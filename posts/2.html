<p>When I was first learning how to code in high school, I wrote a bunch of dinky, fun programs to do all kinds of things. One project I remember in particular was a program to generate a random maze, the kind one can often find on kids' menus in family restaurants. For my inaugural blog post, I thought it would be fun to revisit that program and re-implement it in JavaScript.</p>
